<h1>Download Lispbox</h1>

<p><a href="lispbox.html">Lispbox</a> is designed to given you
everything you need to get up and running, hacking Common Lisp, in one
easy-to-install download. However you do need to pick the right
version of Lispbox for the OS you are using and the Common Lisp
implementation you want to try. However you can also download
individual Common Lisp implementations in Lispbox-ready form to add to
an existing Lispbox installation so the choice of Lisp implementation
you start with doesn't matter a great deal.</p>

<p><b>Note on choosing a Lisp implementation</b>. All of the Lisp
implementations available here are high-quality implementations that
can be used for learning Lisp and for writing real applications.
However if you want to be able to run all the practical examples
from <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"><i>Practical Common
Lisp</i></a> the easiest path is to use Allegro since it supports both
Unicode and threads and has AllegroServe built in. CLISP has excellent
Unicode support but no threads. SBCL added Unicode in version 0.8.17
but there are still, as of this writing, a few wrinkles to work out.
And it supports threads only on GNU/Linux 2.6 systems running on x86.
OpenMCL supports native threads but not Unicode. The ID3 parser
developed
in <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/chapter-25.html">Chapter
25</a> works best in Lisps that support Unicode but will work fine in
non-Unicode Lisps as long as none of the MP3 files you want to parse
contain Unicode strings. And the Shoutcast server developed in
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/chapter-28.html">Chapters
28</a> and
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/chapter-29.html">29</a>
requires an implementation that supports multiple threads.</p>

<p class="download-blurb">To choose the appropriate Lisbox pick the
operating system you are running on and the Common Lisp implementation
you want to try. The numbers in the table's cells are the version of
the Lisp implementation. If you choose Allegro you will need to get a
free licence from Franz's web site; click
on <a href="http://www.franz.com/PracticalCommonLisp">get license</a>
to go to the Franz web site. Lispbox will help you install the license
the first time you run it.</p>
